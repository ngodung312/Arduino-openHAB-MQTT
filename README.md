# Arduino-openHAB-MQTT
Project: Smart Lighting System with ESP8266, openHAB, MQTT.

This is a final project in one of my course: Computer Research Project - CNBU003.L21.ATBC. 

I built a simple smart lighting system that has two rooms: a living room and a bedroom. In each room, there were a LED, a switch and a motion sensor. Through openHAB interfaces (iOS app, Basic UI, etc.), the users can see the current date-time, turn on/off LEDs, enable/disable motion sensors and enable/disable app notifications.

## System Design

## Hardware Setup
About the hardware components, I used ESP8266, 2 PIR motion sensors, 2 LEDs, 2 push-buttons and some resistors as shown in the electrical circuit of the prototype.
